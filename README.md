## About Me

I'm a student at Champlain College studying Computer Networking and Cybersecurity with a minor in Digital Forensics, excited to further my career after I graduate in May 2024.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my capstone project. The project entails the integration of a ticketing system with SIEM functionality. The purpose is to correlate SIEM events and alerts with tickets in order to help identify the source of issues reported in tickets and streamline ticket resolution.
