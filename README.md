- 📝 I am currenty focused on continuing my career. I am looking for opportunities in Cybersecurity and in IT, where I can contribute to a meaningful mission and gain new and valuable eperience. I am excited to keep learning and explore new opportunities that present themselves.

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with meeting individuals in the cybersecurity industry. I am currently looking for job opportunities that will help me further my career. I find that connections are really important in the working world, and I love meeting individuals in the field that will let me pick their brain a bit so I can learn how to improve myself and find the right job fit.

- 🔭 Something that I worked on recently is my capstone project. The project entails the integration of a ticketing system with SIEM functionality. The purpose is to correlate SIEM events and alerts with tickets in order to help identify the source of issues reported in tickets and streamline ticket resolution.
